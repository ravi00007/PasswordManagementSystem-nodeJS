# Description

Once upon a time, during the early years of the Internet, you may have had a handful of passwords for a few essential web applications that you used to shop, study, stay connected, and get work done. Today, things are much more complicated. A 2017 report from LastPass found, on average, people had to remember 191 different passwords—just for work—not to mention their personal passwords.

While technology promises to make our lives easier, and it generally does, every new website and application we sign up for is another password we have to remember. For most, it’s become impossible to remember all of them. 

# benefits of using a password manager

You don’t have to memorize all your passwords anymore. You only need to remember the master password that unlocks your password vault. And if you opt for a cloud-based password manager, you can access your password vault anywhere, from any device.
